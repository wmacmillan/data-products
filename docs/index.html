      <p>A data product company is a firm that provides a service to clients by easing the process of going from data to
        knowledge which informs actions. Data is the first element in a five step sequence to value known as the DIKAR
        model:</p>
      <p>Data $\rightarrow$ Information $\rightarrow$ Knowledge $\rightarrow$ Action $\rightarrow$ Results</p>
      <p>A data product company takes data and transforms the data into information. The information should be presented
        in such a way that it easily produces knowledge for the user.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref"
            href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The goal of a data product company is to efficiently move from data to the
        conditions for knowledge acquition in the user base. For a data product with a subscription fee, users are
        synonomous with clients.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>A data product is a combination of three elements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Data Processing</li>
        <li>User Interface</li>
        <li>Data Curation</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Data curation<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">3</a></sup> carries its own unique status
        in this case, because data has an abstract value above and beyond the technical details of the systems that
        store it and the measurement schemes used to create records.</p>
      <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
      <h3 id="global-definitions">Global Definitions</h3>
      <p>The most critical terms of data product companies are:</p>

        <dt>User</dt>
        <dd>someone who derives value from the use of data. Typically a human, though, can be a post-human automated

        <dd>the computer driven interfacing tool for the humans. Occasionally used with a different meaning to indicate

        <dd>utility, with a homomorphism to USD, derived from providing goods or services that ameliorate the human

      <h2 id="data-curation-projects">Data Curation Projects</h2>
      <p>In a pure data management scenario, data curation is the lifeblood of the work to be done. Fundamentally, it is
        about setting the choice of records to be curated with the data owner, and then appropriately documenting the
        source(s). This is, at its core, not a technical enterprise. However, one will often find themselves engaging in
        deeply technical work to support a data set. This is due to either: a lack of earlier investment of energy; or
        unforseen challenges with a particular dataset. As much as possible the technical elements of processing and
        publishing data should be established in advance of a data curation project.</p>
